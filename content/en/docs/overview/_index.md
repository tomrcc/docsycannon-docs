  What is DocsyCannon?
---
## What is it?

A technical documentation website builder configured for use in CloudCannon's CMS. This template provides a way for non-developers to write documentation without touching any code, or a way for teams of developers and editors to collaborate on the creation of technical documentation.

## Why do I want it?

The main use for DocsyCannon is to provide a way to start building a documentation website without needing any developer experience. Once you create your own repository and build the site on CloudCannon, you can use CloudCannons interface to start writing documentation and blog page content in a text editor.

Other pages, such as the 'homepage' or 'about' page are built using&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop/blob/main/guides/hugo.adoc">Bookshop</a>. Bookshop allows you to build your pages via a library of components. DocsyCannon comes with enough components to get you started, but more can be added if you have developer experience. See our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="www.">example site</a>&nbsp;for more information about the type of content available using DocsyCannon.

## What is it useful for?

DocsyCannon is particularly useful for medium to large technical documentation sets with 20+ pages of docs and/or multiple types of docs and pages: tutorials, reference documentation, blog posts, community pages, and so on.

If you have a smaller project with only a couple of pages of documentation and hence simpler navigation needs, DocsyCannon may be too heavyweight a solution for you. Instead, consider:

* A simpler Hugo theme: find out what’s available in the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">Hugo theme gallery</a>.
* A good README file that tells users what your project does and links to some examples.

If you have a very large documentation project, our example site structure may not be sufficient either, though you can still use our theme, possibly with heavier customisation.
