## What is it?

A technical documentation page builder configured for use in CloudCannon's CMS. This template provides a way for non-developers to write documentation without touching any code, or a way for teams of developers and editors to collaborate on the creation of technical documentation.

## Why do I want it?

DocsyCannon is particularly useful for medium to large technical documentation sets with 20+ pages of docs and/or multiple types of docs and pages: tutorials, reference documentation, blog posts, community pages, and so on.

If you have a smaller project with only a couple of pages of documentation and hence simpler navigation needs, DocsyCannon may be too heavyweight a solution for you. Instead, consider:

* A simpler Hugo theme: find out whatâ€™s available in the&nbsp;[Hugo theme gallery](https://themes.gohugo.io/).
* A good README file that tells users what your project does and links to some examples.

If you have a very large documentation project, our example site structure may not be sufficient either, though you can still use our theme, possibly with heavier customisation.

## Where should I go next?

Give your users next steps from the Overview. For example:

* [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/)\: Get started with $project
* [Examples](/docs/examples/)\: Check out some example code!
