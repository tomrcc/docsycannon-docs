This is the technical documentation for DocsyCannon. DocsyCannon is a fork of Docsy, a&nbsp;[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)&nbsp;theme, meant to help build a documentation website. Docsy gives users a skeleton theme (template) to fill out with their own documentation content. DocsyCannon is Docsy, configured for use in CloudCannon. CloudCannon's Content Management System (CMS) allows editors to build websites without touching any code, while providing the freedom for developers to be able to customise that editing experience.
