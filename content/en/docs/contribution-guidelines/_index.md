Docsy is an open source project and we love getting patches and contributions to make Docsy and its docs even better. Most changes to the theme are best directed there.&nbsp;<br>DocsyCannon will endeavour to keep up to date with the main Docsy theme, and we do not want to divide contributors attention away from the main theme. However, if you have any changes that are specific to DocsyCannon rather than Docsy, we would welcome your contributions.​

## Contributing to Docsy

The Docsy theme itself lives in&nbsp;[https://github.com/google/docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy).

### Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project. Head over to&nbsp;[https://cla.developers.google.com/](https://cla.developers.google.com/)&nbsp;to see your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you’ve already submitted one (even if it was for a different project), you probably don’t need to do it again.

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult&nbsp;[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)&nbsp;for more information on using pull requests.

### Previewing your changes

As Docsy is a theme rather than a site, you can’t serve the theme directly to check your changes work. Instead use your updated local theme in a local copy of the Docsy example site (copy or make your changes in the&nbsp;`themes/docsy`&nbsp;directory) and&nbsp;[preview](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/deployment/)&nbsp;from there. Alternatively, clone the&nbsp;[Docsy theme repo](https://github.com/google/docsy)&nbsp;and test your changes in a local copy of this site, as described&nbsp;[below](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/contribution-guidelines/#previewing-your-changes-locally).

### Community guidelines

This project follows&nbsp;[Google’s Open Source Community Guidelines](https://opensource.google.com/conduct/).

### Creating issues

Alternatively, if there’s something you’d like to see in Docsy (or if you’ve found something that isn’t working the way you’d expect), but you’re not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an&nbsp;[issue](https://github.com/google/docsy/issues)&nbsp;<br><br>If theres something you'd like to see in DocsyCannon, please create an [issue](https://github.com/tomrcc/docsycannon-template/issues)
