A simple way to get started is to use this project as a template, which gives you a site project that is set up and ready to use. To do this:

1. Click&nbsp;**Use this template** on [GitHub](https://github.com/tomrcc/docsycannon-template).
2. Select a name for your new project and click&nbsp;**Create repository from template**.
3. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://app.cloudcannon.com/register?trial=cc_standard">Sign up</a>&nbsp;for CloudCannon using their free trial period.
4. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://cloudcannon.com/community/learn/hugo-cms---get-started-with-cloudcannon/">Build your site</a>.

Once you have a copy of the template live on CloudCannon, navigate to [CloudCannon's CMS](https://app.cloudcannon.com/editor) and edit the contents to suit your needs.
